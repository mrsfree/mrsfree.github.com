Constellation work offers an extremely efficient form of short-term
therapy. It allows access to the right half of the brain and deeper
layers of consciousness.

For <q>major</q> issues, your whole family of origin, for example, the most
effective route is via a traditional constellation setting. Which means
working with a group of people and real human beings. In these group
workshops, people stand-in for family members or other aspects of one's
life. However, not everyone can—or wants to—open up to that extent to a
roomful of strangers. This confidential aspect is why I offer individual
sessions. In these sessions, a client has the opportunity to gain
tremendous insights even from a <q>small</q> constellation, which merely
involves the client, symbols/objects and me.

Even just one hour can often shift a client's perspective and offer new
ways to change or manage a difficult situation.
