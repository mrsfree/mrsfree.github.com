My mother taught medicine at the university - and I knew at age 5 that I
wanted to become either a physician or work in a pharmaceutical company.

At 16, shortly before I finished school, I discovered punk and politics.
After a severe liver disease that conventional medicine could not help
me with, I realized that it wasn't as almighty as I had presumed - and
also that big pharma might just pursue other interests than the quest
for healing.

At age 14, after my parents divorced, I had developed anorexia, and that
also raised questions in me, like: What do we even consider <q>healthy</q> or
<q>unhealthy</q>? How do body and soul interact? How sick is the individual -
in relation to a sick society?

I read a lot of books on psychosomatics and tried to study philosophy,
in the hope that that could provide some answers. Instead I found a
record store and a job as a DJ in a huge club. I fell deeper & deeper in
love with music and it opened whole news levels of consciousness for me.
I didn't go to class often... (Oh Bondage! Up yours!)

I moved to Berlin and started a record store with my DJ partner: MR DEAD
& MRS FREE.

At age 27 I met an astrologer and that became my next obsession. I
started to study astrology and worked in a homoeopathic practice and
went back and forth between two worlds. In order to work with
homoeopathy I started to study regular medicine - but got very
frustrated after 2 or 3 years.

I married and had 3 children.

Just before I got married somebody gave me Bert Hellinger's <q>Ordnungen
der Liebe</q> - and I knew immediately: This is it!

It took a little while before I found a group that was working with
Hellinger's concepts, in 1999. It took a little longer to find the right
teacher for me: in 2012 I started training with Peter Orban (and also
got a degree as <q>Heilpraktiker f√ºr Psychotherapie</q>)

When my kids developed several allergic symptoms, that I had also
suffered with for years, I realized that homoeopathy was not sufficient
to deal with that. I discovered functional medicine and the Paleo diet -
und cooked the whole family free of symptoms within 9 months. We never
want to go back to <q>normal</q> again!

Since that time I coach other people through that same kind of
transition to a healthier diet. Very often that also raises more
<q>psychological</q> issues - as food is so closely related to a lot of
emotions. So I find it extremely efficient and helpful to work on both
aspects - physical and mental/emotional - simultaneously.
