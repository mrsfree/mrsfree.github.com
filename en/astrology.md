Astrology is my favourite tool to help clarify answers to:

Where am I on my life's journey?

Where do I come from?

Where do I want to go?

Where should I go? (And do my ‘wants’ match my ‘shoulds’?)

Does life have a plan in store for me?

Most of all: When will I come to a crossroad and be presented with a choice about my direction?

These are important questions at the outset of therapy or coaching, and consulting your birthchart
allows me a shortcut to the answers and where to prioritise. It helps me to get to know
you faster and thus saves us time and you, money.

An astrological consultation alone can often already offer insightful new perspectives on a problematic situation.

Astrology helps to practice that famous prayer: to have the serenity to accept the things I
cannot change, to have the courage to change the things I can - and the wisdom to know the difference.

When we gain insight into that wisdom, it is then much easier to work on courage and serenity where they are needed.
