Astrology is still my favorite tool to clarify one's position in life:

Where am I on my life's journey? Where do I come from? Where do I want to go? Where should I be going? Is that the same direction, my wanting and my ??

And most of all: When do I stand at the crossroads and actually have a choice to make about my direction?

Is there something like a plan that life has for me?

Those are important questions at the beginning of a therapy or a coaching, and astrology allows me a shortcut to the answers.

Looking at your horoscope helps me to get to know you faster and thus saves time and money in our working together.

Often just an astrological consultation by itself can already offer new perspectives in a difficult situation.

Or keeping the birthchart in mind helps us to prioritize: Where do we go first?

Astrology helps to practice that famous prayer: to have the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, to have the courage to change the things I can - and the wisdom to know the difference.

When we gain insight into that wisdom it is much easier then to work on courage and serenity where they are needed.
