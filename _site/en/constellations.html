	<h1>Constellations</h1>
	<p>Constellation work offers an extremely efficient form of shortterm
therapy. It allows access to the right half of the brain and deeper
layers of consciousness.</p>

<p>For a “big” problem the best way to go is mostly a classical setting,
working with a group of people and real human beings to stand-in for
family members or other aspects of one’s life. Not everybody though
likes to open up to that extent to a roomful of strangers. So it often
there can be tremendous insights even from a “small” constellation, with
just the client + me + symbols .</p>

<p>Even just one hour can sometimes help to shift perspective and offer new
ways of dealing with a difficult situation.</p>
