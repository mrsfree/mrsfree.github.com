	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My mother taught medicine at the university - and I knew at age 5 that I
wanted to become either a physician or work in a pharmaceutical company.</p>

<p>At 16, shortly before I finished school, I discovered punk and politics.
After a severe liver disease that conventional medicine could not help
me with, I realized that it wasn’t as almighty as I had presumed - and
also that big pharma might just pursue other interests than the quest
for healing.</p>

<p>At age 14, after my parents divorced, I had developed anorexia, and that
also raised questions in me, like: What do we even consider “healthy” or
“unhealthy”? How do body and soul interact? How sick is the individual -
in relation to a sick society?</p>

<p>I read a lot of books on psychosomatics and tried to study philosophy,
in the hope that that could provide some answers. Instead I found a
record store and a job as a DJ in a huge club. I fell deeper &amp; deeper in
love with music and it opened whole news levels of consciousness for me.
I didn’t go to class often… (Oh Bondage! Up yours!)</p>

<p>I moved to Berlin and started a record store with my DJ partner: MR DEAD
&amp; MRS FREE.</p>

<p>At age 27 I met an astrologer and that became my next obsession. I
started to study astrology and worked in a homoeopathic practice and
went back and forth between two worlds. In order to work with
homoeopathy I started to study regular medicine - but got very
frustrated after 2 or 3 years.</p>

<p>I married and had 3 children.</p>

<p>Just before I got married somebody gave me Bert Hellinger’s “Ordnungen
der Liebe” - and I knew immediately: This is it!</p>

<p>It took a little while before I found a group that was working with
Hellinger’s concepts, in 1999. It took a little longer to find the right
teacher for me: in 2012 I started training with Peter Orban (and also
got a degree as “Heilpraktiker für Psychotherapie”)</p>

<p>When my kids developed several allergic symptoms, that I had also
suffered with for years, I realized that homoeopathy was not sufficient
to deal with that. I discovered functional medicine and the Paleo diet -
und cooked the whole family free of symptoms within 9 months. We never
want to go back to “normal” again!</p>

<p>Since that time I coach other people through that same kind of
transition to a healthier diet. Very often that also raises more
“psychological” issues - as food is so closely related to a lot of
emotions. So I find it extremely efficient and helpful to work on both
aspects - physical and mental/emotional - simultaneously.</p>
